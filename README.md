TravelSync

**Problem Motivation**

While planning our own holiday to Japan, we found it challenging to coordinate destinations and accommodations, especially while researching everything simultaneously. With numerous tabs open and scattered information, it quickly became overwhelming and difficult to track which hotels were located near which attractions. This experience inspired us to create a single, streamlined platform where all options can be organised in one place, making it easier for everyone to stay on the same page when planning a trip together.

**Project Scope**

TravelSync will be a platform designed to help travellers visualise and organise their holiday plans in a clear, timeline-based format. It will allow users to explore and compare various options, such as hotels and nearby activities, before making a final selection. Key details like price, location, and amenities are displayed at a glance, making it easy to review and decide on the best choices all in one place.

TravelSync will also support collaborative planning whereby users on the same trip can suggest hotels to stay or activities to do all on the same platform which will allow all planners to be on the same page.

Ultimately, we want TravelSync to make information gathering and sharing, especially when there are multiple people involved, to be more streamlined and efficient so that the process of planning a trip does not become such a hassle.

**Features**

1. Hotel Booking (core): allows for easy comparisons of prices of hotels and its location between hotels of different websites.  

2. Itinerary Planner (core): For each day of the trip, users can input certain activities, and a hotel they stay in for that night (except the day they fly off).  

3. Collaborative Itinerary (core): allows users to create a group which multiple parties can access. There is a master planner who decides which hotels/activities to choose. However, other people can add suggestions for the master planner to see and compare. This allows for cleaner collaboration between multiple parties.  

4. Map Display (core): there’ll be a map which marks the location of each suggested hotel to allow users to have visual representation of where each possible hotel is located for easier comparison.

5. Travel Time (extension): be able to display the expected time taken to travel from location 1 to location 2, so that it is easier to plan what time to depart from location 1\.  

6. Expense Splitting (extension): allows users to select which person pays for which items, or to just even split the bill.
